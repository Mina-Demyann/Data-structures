# Data Structures

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in Python. It is designed for educational purposes, helping users understand the fundamentals of data structures and their applications. Each implementation is included as a separate file for modularity and clarity.

### This repository was created by Mina-Demyann and Nasser-Hana.

## Data Structures Implemented

### Linear Data Structures

#### Linked Lists
- **Linked List**: A basic implementation of a singly linked list.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Similar to a linked list but includes pointers to both the next and previous nodes.
- **Doubly Sorted Linked List**: An extension of the doubly linked list with elements sorted in ascending order.
- **Circular Linked List**: A linked list where the last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.

#### Stacks and Queues
- **Stack**: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure.
- **Linked Stack**: A stack implementation using linked nodes.
- **Queue**: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure.
- **Linked Queue**: A queue implementation using linked nodes.

### Non-Linear Data Structures

#### Trees
- **Binary Search Tree**: A tree where each node has at most two children, with left child values less than the node and right child values greater.
- **Tree**: A generic tree structure.

#### Sets
- **Set**: A collection of unique elements with basic set operations.

## Repository Structure

Each data structure is implemented as a standalone Python file, following consistent and modular coding practices. This structure allows users to focus on individual data structures and understand their implementations in isolation.

## Usage

Clone the repository and navigate to the desired data structure file to review its implementation and usage examples. For example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mina-Demyann/Data-structures.git
cd Data-structures
```
